## 🔰 Hosting it yourself?
There's only two steps required to get this bot up-and-running. Our release builds only support 64-bit, if you'd like to run this on a different architecture you will have to compile the project yourself, this is also true if you wish to host this bot on MacOS.
1) Copy the repository's .env.example as a `.env` file & fill in required information
2) Download our [latest release](https://github.com/Headline/discord-compiler-bot/releases/) build & place it in the same directory as the `.env` file. For windows download `discord-compiler-bot.exe` & for linux download `discord-compiler-bot`.
3) Start the bot
